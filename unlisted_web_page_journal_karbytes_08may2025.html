<p>This note elaborates upon some of the concepts which were discussed in the conversation whose abridged plain-text transcript is available at the following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Resource Locator</a> (and those concepts are what karbytes found to be most personally meaningful to karbytes in that conversation): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_38/main/chatgpt_karbytes_07may2025_p0.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_38/main/chatgpt_karbytes_07may2025_p0.txt</a></p>

<p>((*) Note that, within the context of this journal entry, the word &#8220;qualia&#8221; is intended to be synonymous with the word &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; as defined by the following web page: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/</a>).</p>

<p>Suppose there exists an unconditionally present (i.e. with neither a temporal beginning nor temporal ending) and immutable (i.e. unchanging or unchangeable) instance of consciousness, <strong style="color:#2b08ba">X</strong>, which contains every subjective (and, by implication of the word &#8220;subjective&#8221;, also <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;solipsistic&#8221;</a>) experience which ever occurs throughout every universe and throughout every <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiverse</a>.</p>
<p>X can be conceptually modeled as an entirely self-aware <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/pointers_and_arrays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">array</a> whose elements are sub-arrays which each represent a particular universe (as rendered by a particular frame of reference which appears to itself to be exactly one spatially finite pattern of matter and energy (packaged as a single <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">information processing agent</a>) traveling unidirectionally and at a constant rate along exactly one temporal trajectory while rendering exactly one irreducibly small configuration of matter, energy, and empty space per irreducibly small unit of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time</a>).</p>
<p><strong style="color:#2b08ba">X[i]</strong> is a sub-array of X.</p>
<p>X[i] is a simulated universe which encompasses the spatially and temporally localized perspectives of exactly one information processing agent, <strong style="color:#2b08ba">X[i].A</strong>.</p>
<p>X[i].A experiences the passage of time while simultaneously possibly observing the emergence and disappearance of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qualia*</a> (within the context of X[i].A&#8217;s respective simulated universe).</p>
<p><strong style="color:#2b08ba">X[i][k]</strong> is a particular irreducibly small snapshot of X[i].A&#8217;s rendered experiences occurring at some <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">point</a>, <strong style="color:#2b08ba">k</strong>, within X[i]&#8217;s <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">timeline</a>.</p>
<p>X is simultaneously and unconditionally aware of every element of X[i] while X[i].A is only aware of exactly one element of X[i] at any point within X[i]&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>X[i].A is only aware of X[i][k] at the point, k, in X[i]&#8217;s timeline (where k is a variable representing any arbitrary point along X[i]&#8217;s timeline).</p>
<p>X is simultaneously and unconditionally aware of every element of every sub-array of X.</p>
